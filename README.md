# Atari Boxing Project

This repository implements a **multi-agent reinforcement learning system** for the Atari Boxing environment. The goal of this project is to create two intelligent agents that compete against each other in the boxing game, learn from their interactions, and improve their performance over time. The agents are trained using **deep Q-learning** and work in parallel to ensure dynamic and competitive gameplay.

## 🛠️ Installation

1\. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AtariBoxingProject.git

   cd AtariBoxingProject

   ```

2\. **Install Dependencies**

   Use the `requirements.txt` file to install dependencies:

   ```bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

3\. **Add ROMs**

   Place the necessary Atari Boxing ROM files in the `roms/` directory. Ensure you have legal access to these files.

4\. **Configure Hyperparameters**

   Edit `config.yaml` to customize parameters like:

   - Learning rate

   - Discount factor

   - Epsilon decay

   > Note:
The PettingZoo Atari Boxing environment is only available for Mac/Linux/Unix systems. Windows systems will not support this package.

## 🚀 Usage

### Training the Agents

To train the agents:

```bash

python training/train.py

```

This script initializes the environment, trains the agents, and saves checkpoints periodically.

### Evaluating the Agents

To evaluate performance after training:

```bash

python training/evaluation.py

```

This runs the trained agents against each other and logs their performance.

### Running the Game

Launch the trained agents in the Atari Boxing environment:

```bash

python main.py

```

Observe the agents' strategies and gameplay.

### Running Tests

Run unit tests to ensure code functionality:

```bash

python test.py

```


> Note for Linux/Unix Users:
By default, the code is configured for Mac systems. To run on Linux/Unix systems, modify the environment initialization code in the following files:

multi_agent.py

cnn_model.py

train.py

evaluation.py




Replace:

env = boxing_v2.env(render_mode="human")

with:

env = boxing_v2.env(render_mode="human", auto_rom_install_path="roms")

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### 1. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**

The project uses a multi-agent version of DQN where each agent is represented by a CNN and trains independently while competing in the shared environment.

### 2. **CNN Architecture**

The CNN processes game frames and extracts features. The architecture includes:

- 3 convolutional layers for feature extraction.

- Fully connected layers for decision-making.

- Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation for non-linearity.

### 3. **Replay Buffer**

Stores past experiences (`state`, `action`, `reward`, `next_state`) and samples mini-batches for training to ensure better convergence.

### 4. **Environment Wrapper**

Simplifies interaction with the PettingZoo environment by:

- Normalizing observations.

- Stacking consecutive frames for temporal awareness.

## 📊 Results

- **Training Progress**: Agents progressively learn strategies to maximize their scores.

- **Competitive Dynamics**: Both agents adapt to each other's strategies, leading to engaging matches.

- **Model Performance**: The agents demonstrate high accuracy in predicting optimal actions after sufficient training.
